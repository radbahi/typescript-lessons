Types - Easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has.

Primitive types: number, boolean, void, undefined, null, symbol, string
Object types: functions, arrays, classes, objects

Types are used by the Typescript compiler to analyze our code for errors. Types allow other engineers to understand whart values are
floating around our codebase.

You pretty much use types everywhere. Every value you define will have a type associated with it.
